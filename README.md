### About me
Hey! I'm a programming student and future Scrum Master 🚀. I love teamwork because there’s always something new to learn. I believe in good programming practices, from clean code to an agile workflow. Right now, I'm diving into Git, GitHub, and design patterns to level up each project, and I’m fascinated by exploring new technologies with AI 🤖. Oh, and I'm a fan of cats and plants! 🐱🌿
